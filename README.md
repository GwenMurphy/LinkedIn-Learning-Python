If the laptop I'm using for it could go more than 15 minutes without freezing for no reason, that'd be great. It's running like it was coded by Clarkson, May and Hammond in a shed somewhere in Hampshire about 15 years ago when they were probably given a task to colonise Mars using nothing but sticky tape, a 1963 Triumph Herald that barely passed its MOT, and my boss's ferocious and unassuageable loathing of printers. I'm surprised I managed to type this before it did the thing again.
